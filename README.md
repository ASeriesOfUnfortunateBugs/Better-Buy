# Better Buy

This was the final project in the web applications program at my school. The purpose of the project was to show that I and my fellow students had fully learned the tools necessary to develop an application as part of a team. Passing this class was a requirement for graduation so we all put everything we had into this project.

Better Buy is an e-commerce web app built with HTML, Bootstrap, JQuery, and Java. The course instructor assigned students to each team, assigned a theme for the application, and set the requirements. Our instructions were to build an e-commerce web app for an electronics retail company. The requirements were as follows:

* Customers should be able to browse the products on the website
* Customers should be able to make purchases without creating an account
* Customers should have the option of creating an account
* Customers should be able to check out using the information on their account
* Customers should be able to view and make changes to the information on their account
* There should be a products page and a sales page
* There should be an admin account that is accessible via the login page
* There should be an admin only page
   * The admin page should have a table showing order information from the database
   * The admin should be able to change the status of the orders, indicating whether they have been readied, shipped, or picked up

We were not given any starting code or databases for this project. Everything we did was designed and developed from scratch.

Our first decision regarding this project was how we wanted to approach the development process. We decided on a hybrid Agile approach where we would meet online via Discord every week to discuss our progress and assign duties. We divided our team of five students into a front-end team and a back-end team.
